## Onboarding experience

We chose a new project since the previous project was a collection of algorithms which was not suitable for this assignment. The onboarding process for this project was more complicated since the overall software is more advanced and the code complexity is also higher. However, the project provides detailed documentation of how to set up a local environment in order to build and work on the project. While the setup took some time to complete it was well documented and easy to follow.

## Effort spent

For each team member, how much time was spent in

1. plenary discussions/meetings;

2. discussions within parts of the group;

3. reading documentation;

4. configuration and setup;

5. analyzing code/output;

6. writing documentation;

7. writing code;

8. running code?

For setting up tools and libraries (step 4), enumerate all dependencies
you took care of and where you spent your time, if that time exceeds
30 minutes.
